MarcheProcessor
===============

A wide-word pipelined processor with 128-bit data path.

+ *Verilog* RTL design of the 4-stage pipelined *Troy Wideword Processor*, with 128-bit datapath.
+ *Verilog* testbenches have been developed for each *Verilog* module to support unit testing and regression testing. A *Makefile* is provided for "build automation" (or the automation of analyzing and elaborating the RTL designs, and simulating them).
+ See [MarcheProcessor](https://github.com/eda-ricercatore/MarcheProcessor) for the *Verilog* source code for this project.
+ See [TROY_AJM_ZO.pdf](https://github.com/eda-ricercatore/eda-ricercatore.github.io/blob/master/vecchi-progetti/vlsi-design-projects/TROY_AJM_ZO.pdf) for the project report.
